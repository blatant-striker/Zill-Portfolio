                    <p>Addressing a critical fulfillment challenge - managing multi-seller orders across distributed warehouses, through user research we identified, our warehouse operations team needed automated yet flexible order processing for different situations.</p>
                    <p>We developed a dynamic order-splitting algorithm to automate fulfillment decisions based on inventory, warehouse proximity, and delivery optimization. To ensure flexibility, a manual override feature was added for special cases and peak demand periods.</p>

                    <p>This hybrid approach balanced efficiency with flexibility, streamlining shipping, reducing costs, and preserving the human touch crucial in B2B operations. It showcased how user-centric design and operational excellence can resolve complex supply chain challenges.</p>

                    <p>We recognized that modern schools operate across multiple locations with diverse administrative needs. We built a robust platform that allows schools to register each branch as distinct centers within their organization, creating a unified yet flexible procurement structure.</p>
                    <p>When schools place B2B orders, products are automatically routed to the correct branch location, ensuring supplies reach the right students at the right campus. Students can be enrolled directly into the system and linked to their respective campuses, streamlining the ordering process.</p>

The integrated POS system not only tracked purchases but also managed inventory across multiple school locations, giving administrators real-time visibility of their supplies.</p>
                    <p>We enabled schools to monitor product distribution to students and maintain accurate stock levels at each campus location. The system provided insights into consumption patterns, helping schools optimize their bulk purchases and predict future needs.</p>
